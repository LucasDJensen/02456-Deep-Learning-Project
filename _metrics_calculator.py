Helper functions for evaluating various types of performance scores across simulations.

The main block script reads all the simulated time series from a HYPE simulation and a Qobs file.
The user of the script then defines time periods (start and end timestamps) for the calibration and validation periods,
and then the script calculates performance metrics such as KGE and NSE for calibration and validation periods.

PERFORMANCE METRICS SHOULD HAVE f(sim,obs,*args) AS INPUTS SO THEY CAN BE USED SYSTEMATICALLY IN SEVERAL SCRIPTS
